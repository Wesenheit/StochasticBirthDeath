# StochasticBirthDeath

Julia simulations for Birth-death stochastic process.

1D
Birth death process with givven birth and death intensity

2D
mRNA particles are born and killed with given intensity. Protein particles are built with given intensity (per mRNA particle) and are dying with given intensity (per protein particle)
